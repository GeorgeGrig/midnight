## Steampunk Lamp
{: class="header"}

I really enjoy the steampunk aesthetic and when I randomly came across these kind of lamps I immediately wanted one.  

However these are not mass produced and generally cost 200€ or more.  

That's why I decided to build one on my own, the build was quite easy, I just found a relatively simple design I liked and copied it.  

First I assembled the general structure without any electronics inside.

This base style was not a great idea, it's really unsteady but I didn't bother while building it and I'm too lazy to make changes now.  

After priming and painting the pipes I started working on the electronics

The electronics consist of a simple cable, a variable supply, some fancy braided cable for the ends, the steampunk style sockets and ofcourse, edison style lamps to match the aesthetic.  

The final product:

It was a fun project but I would definitely make a better base, the total cost was around 50€ with the most expensive part being the pipes.
